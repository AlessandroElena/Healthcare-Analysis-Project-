#PROJECT SUMMARY

In this healthcare diagnosis analysis project, we focused on several key performance indicators (KPIâ€™s) to enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
The analysis included metrics such as the number of patients across various summaries, a comparison of profit versus non-profit organizations, and the performance of chain organizations in terms of their total performance scores. 
Additionally, we evaluated dialysis station statistics, categorized text metrics, and the average payment reduction rate.                         
This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights for optimizing healthcare delivery and financial management within the system.
